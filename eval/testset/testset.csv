q015,"How do I roll back to firmware 4.1.3 if 4.2.0 introduces reactive power instability?",firmware,4,procedure,"Download image 4.1.3 from Support, upload via Maintenance > Firmware > Manual Upload, select 'Allow rollback', confirm, and monitor for the green heartbeat before re-enabling grid sync."
q016,"Which data points does the anomaly detector use when scoring inverter health?",analytics,3,multi-fact,"Health scoring ingests 15-minute averages of DC voltage, DC current, AC frequency, heat-sink temp, and error counter deltas."
q017,"What steps verify successful integration with the utility SCADA system?",integration,4,procedure,"Confirm Modbus TCP handshake, validate points list 47A matches SCADA tags, run the telemetry test script, and capture logs showing ACK on control commands."
q018,"Explain the conditions that trigger battery reserve mode on hybrid sites.",battery,3,definition,"Reserve mode starts when forecasted load exceeds generation, SOC drops under the reserve threshold, or a grid outage notice arrives via Flex API."
q019,"How can I check if a site uses the new string-level IV curve scanning feature?",features,2,factoid,"Look under Diagnostics > IV Scans; if 'String-level IV (beta)' toggle is enabled and scan history shows dataset version 2024.7, the feature is active."
